12|13|"P.O.V."|TJ Perez|Theresa-Perez2.png|Have you ever wanted to live life through a different point of view? Ever wonder what the soundtrack of your life would be like if you were a pirate? If you lived in a fantasy world? If you were walking the red carpet? Tune in to P.O.V. to hear a different themed playlist every week. Perfect for the fellow maladaptive daydreamer or just anyone looking for an escape!
13|14|"Riccardo and Mannion"|Michael Riccardo|Michael-Riccardo.png|Depending ofc on how often my show airs I will talk about all recent sports news and ofc highlight the New York teams and what’s going on with them. Think about it as a WFAN type special. I’m looking for a co star and in that case it will be named with our last names (ie: Riccardo and _______). We will also mention some pop culture stuff and even how our teams on campus are doing.

18|19|"Sigma Male Movie Talks"|Wade Wiedemann and Sophie Ryan|Wade-Wiedemann.jpg|It's a talk show where we both review recent movies we've watched, and also play songs that we feel generally match the vibe and/or encapsulate our response to the film.
