10|12|"Morning Mashup"|Marley Saal|Marley-Saal.jpeg|Music Mash-ups/Remixes, with me occasionally talking about something kinda related to the music. Mostly hip-hop mashed up with video game/anime OSTs. Like a mix of a standard radio show and a podcast.

20|21|"Sportsfreak Radio"|Sean Fandel|Sean-Fandel.png|I will be talking about the NHL,NFL,MLB and NBA. Like breaking news, scores, player of the game, fantasy news, who you should play who not to play. Key games to watch. Players to lookout for. 
21|22|"Tan Mountains"|Alanna Mia Cordero|Alanna-Cordero.jpg|My show will include an array of different music types depending on the weather of the day and how I'm feeling. Foggy days with cold nights will most likely get Sade and warmer days with clear skies will get Deaton Chris Anthony and so on. I will talk mostly about self-development both in a college space and real-life space. Asking and trying to give my perspective on questions like "What is the right perspective? The way we perceive ourselves or the way others perceive us?" and "If relationships consist of two people at different depths can it survive? Can it only thrive if one person decides to go deeper or if one person decides to live on the surface level". My main focus will be on the life journeys of young people, answering questions about how to deal with our struggles, how do we mend through friendships, relationships and so on. All this wrapped in a pretty bow of well thought out music choice or just the classics. Also, my favorite band is Veruca Salt so each session will end with one of their songs but start with my new recent favorite.
