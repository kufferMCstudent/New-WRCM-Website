Possible themes include songs that use a specific type of instruments, vocalists that sing in specific style, pop music suites, different types of lyric writing and much more.

Politics, shows, music, movies, etc etc. For this show, I not only want to express my extremely hot takes, but I want to engage with the audience.

18|19|"The Carlos Variety Hour"|Carlos Santana|Carlos-Santana.png|"Hosted by Carlos Santana (No Relation), The Variety Hour tackles a myriad of topics, ranging from Pop Culture News, media reviews, pseudo-intellectual ramblings, Wikipedia history lessons, and much more. All this is presented with a touch of pretension, blended with attempted humility, and sandwiched with terrible jokes. Additionally, the Variety Hour serves as a showcase for a wide selection of overlooked and under appreciated musical pieces. The show listens to all feedback and suggestions, and will play songs on request. Donâ€™t miss out,  tune in every week at (scheduled time and day of week). "
