                        Originally founded in the mid-1970's, the station was registered with the FCC for local AM radio broadcasting. Sometime in the late 1980's, however, as legend has it some engineers took WRCM's antenna and amplified the signal, bouncing it off of the George Washington Bridge. This interfered with a major NYC radio station and the FCC revoked WRCM's broadcasting license and the station seemed to be at its end.

                    <h4>
                        That was until the early 2000's, when an inventive group of students decided to resurrect the station as an internet radio station. Armed with an ethernet connection and a whole lot of CD's, the station began broadcasting once again in 2004. As the decade moved on, the station again petered out before being resurrected around 2013, and its most recent iteration being Fall 2018.

The Executive board continues to seek out for opportunities for club membership to represent the club in a public way and provide entertainment for the Manhattan College Community. A collection of shirts, stickers, and other merchandise designs are sourced from the community and distributed to bring awareness to the club. The yearly zine publication is a way for students to submit creative works to be printed and distributed as an anthology of work and shared with the greater MC community.
